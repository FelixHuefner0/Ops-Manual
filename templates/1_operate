<h2>1.4 Flight Operations</h2>

<h3>1.4.13 Operations above 400 ft AGL</h3>
<p>
    Operations above 400 ft AGL (measured from the point directly below the RPA) require official authorisation.
    Before seeking approval, the CRP must conduct an assessment to show any added risks and controls.
    Items to be considered include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>proximity to obstacles (shielding)</li>
    <li>crewed aircraft flight paths</li>
    <li>ability to maintain VLOS</li>
    <li>aeronautical radio requirements</li>
    <li>NOTAM requirements</li>
    <li>environmental conditions</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.4.14 Operations outside of VLOS</h3>
<p>
    RPA must not be flown outside of VLOS without CASA approval.
    If CASA has authorised the operation, procedures can be found in Appendix A.
</p>

<h3>1.4.15 Indoor (contained) operations</h3>
<p>
    The CRP may approve indoor operations. Where the operation is within the no-fly zones of a controlled or uncontrolled
    aerodrome, the CRP must consider the requirements of PART 101 MOS 4.04 and 9.05, respectively, when approving the task.
</p>
<p>
    Indoor operations may occur during relevant events. Refer to Appendix D for the specialised operating procedures.
</p>

<h3>1.4.16 Tethered operations</h3>
{% if tethered_ops %}
<p>
    The CRP may approve tethered operations.
    Despite the Part 101 MOS 4.04, CASA approval is required for tethered operations in the no-fly zone of a controlled aerodrome.
</p>
<p>
    Tethered operations within the no-fly zones of a non-controlled aerodrome are allowed without extra CASA approval, provided
    they meet the Part 101 MOS 9.05 requirements.
</p>
<p>
    Tethered operations within the no-fly zone of a non-controlled aerodrome are permitted during relevant events.
    For the specialised tethered operation procedures, refer to Appendix A.
</p>

{% endif %}

<h3>1.4.17 Environmental and weather monitoring</h3>
<p>
    RP must check the prevailing environmental and weather conditions throughout each operation.
    If conditions deteriorate during an operation, the RP must land the RPA as soon as reasonably practical and
    suspend the operation until the conditions are within the limits of the RPAS as per the relevant section of Appendix C.
